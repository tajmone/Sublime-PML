The _PML Dark_ colour scheme is based on the __Base16 Railcast__ colour scheme, created by Ryan Bates (http://railscasts.com), originally released under the terms of the MIT License as part of the (now defunct) __Base16 Builder__ project:

Although the __Base16 Builder__ repository is no longer available, I'm providing here its original license since that's the project from which I took the YAML scheme.

The __Base16 Railcast__ scheme can still be found at the [base16-unclaimed-schemes] project, but the repository doesn't contain a license file.

The _PML Dark_ colour scheme is based on the [Relaxed Theme] colour scheme by [Michael Kühnel], which is a derivative work of the [Afterglow] scheme by [José María Clemente], which in turn was derived from the [idlefingers] scheme (author unknown).

The original scheme palette was extracted from the [`themes/Relaxed`][themes/Relaxed] file of the [relaxed-terminal-themes] repository.

Syntax Improvements
-------------------

### Document and Chapter Titles ###

Added syntax support for inline nodes inside `[doc [title`
and `[ch [title`, and updated the color scheme to render
chapter title sub-nodes correctly against the title's light
background color.

Before indexing, chapter headings are stripped from any
font-formatting tags, newline sequences and spurious spaces,
to beautify look-up operations in the **Goto Symbol** panel.

Any other inline tags within `[ch` titles are preserved in their
indexed representation, partly due to difficulties in handling
their (optional) attributes, and partly because their occurrence
within titles is fairly rare.

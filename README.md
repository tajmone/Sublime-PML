# About PML

> The [Practical Markup Language][PML] (PML) is a new, free, advanced document markup language.
>
> PML simplifies the process of writing technical and non-technical web articles and books that look good out-of-the-box and are highly customizable.
>
> PML is still in its early days, but it is well suited for many kinds of web documents.

PML was designed by [Christian Neumanns] around 2019, and since February 2021 the full source code of the PML converter is available on GitHub under GPLv2 license:

- https://github.com/pml-lang/converter

Precompiled binaries of the PML converter for Windows and Linux [can be downloaded from the official website][Get PML].

For more information on how PML was born, and its advantages over other lightweight markup languages, see Christian Neumanns's article [_We need a new document markup language  — here is why_][2019article].
